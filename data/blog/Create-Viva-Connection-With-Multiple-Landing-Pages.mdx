# Intro

Viva Connections is a new feature of Microsoft Teams that allows you to bring your SharePoint intranet into Teams. It lets you create personalized and engaging experiences for your employees, such as news, announcements, resources, and tools.

But what if you have a decentralized organization with multiple home sites on a tenant? How can you create different apps for each site and customize them according to your branding and preferences?

In this blog post, I will show you how to create multiple apps for Viva Connections using SharePoint communication sites, developer portal, and Teams admin center. You will learn how to:

- Set up your communication sites as home sites for each company or country
- Create custom icons and names for each app
- Publish your apps to Teams using developer portal
- Manage your apps using Teams admin center

## Prerequisites

Before you start creating multiple apps for Viva Connections, make sure you have the following:

- Microsoft Teams admin role (to add Viva Connections)
- SharePoint admin role
- Communication site for each company or country
- A custom name for each app
- Custom icons in PNG format, 192x192 pixels and 32x32 pixels in size
- Developer portal app installed in Teams

## Recommended:

- A hub site per Company with hub navigation.
- Global Navigation
- A theme for each company based on their graphical profile

This is not the full connection suite, you won't get access to a custom dashboard as this requires a home site!

1. Visit Teams and press apps

2. Search after the developer portal
