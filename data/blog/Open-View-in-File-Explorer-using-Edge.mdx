So a nice feature that existed in the days of Internet Explorer and classic SharePoint was that you should open a document library locally on your PC, which could simplfy things for open
This feature is now again avaiable for SharePoint Online using Edge and all you need to do it some simple edit in your registery!

Requirements:

- PC with Windows 10 or 11
- SharePoint admin
- PowerShell 7
- PnP Powershell Module
- Local adminsitrator

1. First of check that you have edge version 93 and above, you can find this under this [Link](edge://settings/help)

2. Open regedit:

3. Navigate to [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Edge]

4. Create a new String variable called: "ConfigureViewInFileExplorer"

5. Set it as "[{"cookies": ["rtFa", "FedAuth"], "domain": "crescentintranet.sharepoint.com"}]"

6. Now install Powershell 7 + PnP Powershell if you don't have it!

7. use this script to configure everything

´´´
Connect-PnPOnline -URL "yourtentant-admin@sharepoint.com"
//checks current settings
Get-PnPTenant | Select ViewInFileExplorerEnabled
//Sets the setting
Set-PnPTenant -ViewInFileExplorerEnabled $true
Set-PnPTenant -UsePersistentCookiesForExplorerView $true

´´´

And now it should work :smile:
