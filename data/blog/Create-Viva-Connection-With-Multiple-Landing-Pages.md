---WIP---

So it's not that uncommon that some companiesS are very decentrialised and that they have multiple home sites on a tenant
This usually means that each company/country/etc has their own sites in that tenant.
So this is a step to step guide for creating multiple apps!

Requirements:

- Microsoft Teams admin (To add Viva Connection)
- SharePoint admin
- Communication Site
- Custom name for each app
- Custom icons in PNG, 192X192 and 32x32 in size
- Developer portal

Recommended:

- A hub site per Company with hub navigation.
- A theme for each company based on their graphical profile

This is not the full connection suite, you won't get access to a custom dashboard as this requires a home site!

1. Visit Teams and press apps

2. Search after developer portal

3. Press App and then New app on the top bar

4. This is the example configuration:
