# Introduction

In the previous post we went though what the organization needs to think about and prepare on a organizational level such as who are the stakeholders, defining the Use-cases with some examples of what different departments can benefit from using Copilot! This is to give an idea of what it can be used for an what you can use to calculate ROI on!

The plan for this post is to get a bit more technical about what kind of prep work that is needed from you in Microsoft 365 to increase the success rate but also getting the right information, because Copilot works best if it has good data and it can't figure out what's good data and not. So that's up to you and your organization to do, and this is something that really needs to be pushed from above and down!

And this is what I'm going to deeper in this post!

## Identify your sources

So, Copilot uses various sources to gather their data, some are your data sources and some are from public sources.

Data Sources:

- Microsoft Graph: This is a unified API that connects to data from various Microsoft 365 services, such as Outlook, Teams, SharePoint, OneDrive, and more. M365 copilot uses Microsoft Graph to access the user's calendar, email, contacts, files, chats, and other information that can help the user manage their tasks and projects.

- Azure Cognitive Services: This is a collection of AI-powered services that enable M365 copilot to perform natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, and other cognitive tasks. M365 copilot uses Azure Cognitive Services to analyze the user's voice, text, images, and videos, and provide relevant feedback and suggestions.

- Bing Search: This is a web search engine that provides access to billions of web pages, images, videos, news, and other online content. M365 copilot uses Bing Search to find relevant information and resources for the user's queries and needs.

- Leveraging Plugins: Plugins are a key enabler for connecting Copilot to external data. They provide live access to external services without the need for pre-indexing data. This means that Copilot can retrieve the latest information and respond to your prompts in real time:

- OpenAI Plugins: Access external APIs and data using a simple YAML file interface.

- Microsoft Teams Message Extensions: Integrate Copilot with third-party applications and services within Teams.

- Power Platform Connectors: Leverage Power Platform data and automation capabilities.

Plugins allow Copilot to retrieve real-time data as needed to respond to your prompts, enhancing its ability to provide accurate and up-to-date information. They also enable Copilot to take direct actions through plugins, such as updating records or triggering workflows.

## Don't be afraid of deleting data

## Permissions are important!

## Retention Policy and Sensitivity Labels!
