# Why I Chose Education Over Technology for M365 Governance (A Consultant's Journey)

After years of implementing Microsoft 365 governance across organizations of all sizes, I've discovered one critical truth: you can't solve educational challenges with technology alone. Let me share a story that completely transformed my approach to M365 governance, focusing on SharePoint, Teams, and Viva Engage.

## The Wake-Up Call

My wake-up call came from observing a recurring pattern across multiple clients. Every organization I worked with faced the same issues:

- **Restricted M365 Group Creation:** Organizations implemented strict controls over who could create M365 groups, hoping to manage the chaos in Teams, SharePoint, and Viva Engage.
- **Superficial Solutions:** These restrictions didn't address the root problems. Instead of solving the main issues, they merely imposed limitations on users.
- **User Restrictions:** By heavily restricting users, companies inadvertently hindered productivity and collaboration.
- **Expensive Third-Party Tools:** Most solutions relied on costly third-party SaaS or consulting companies, with price tags ranging from SEK 100,000 to SEK 500,000 and more
- **Developer Attrition:** These expensive and restrictive approaches often led to the loss of in-house developers, as resources were diverted to maintain these solutions.
- **Lack of Standardization:** There was no standardized approach, resulting in inconsistent governance practices and increased complexity.

I realized that throwing technology at these educational issues was not the answer. These organizations were investing heavily in tools that didn't address the underlying need for user understanding and empowerment. It became clear that a different approach was necessary—one that focused on education rather than mere restriction.

## A Different Approach

Instead of recommending another expensive tool, I proposed something radical: invest in education for the users. Not just basic training, but comprehensive, practical education about why governance matters and how to implement it effectively within the M365 ecosystem. So they understand what they are doing

The CFO was skeptical. "You want us to spend money on training instead of a governance solution?"

"Yes," I replied, "because governance without understanding is just expensive restriction."

## The Finance Department Experiment

We started with their finance department—the most resistant to change, in my experience. But this time, we took a different route: instead of imposing a structure, we built one around their actual work patterns.

During our discovery sessions, we uncovered that the team naturally organized their work around monthly closes, quarterly reporting, and annual audits. We decided to structure their M365 environment to mirror these workflows, making governance a seamless part of their daily routines.

## Empowering Through Education

The transformation was remarkable. Once people understood the 'why' behind governance, the 'how' became almost intuitive. We implemented a straightforward system:

1. **Interactive Course:** Before anyone gets the ability to create a new Team or M365 group, they had to complete a short, engaging course. This wasn’t dull compliance training but interactive modules based on real scenarios from my consulting experience.

   - _“Here’s what happened when a team didn’t have two owners...”_
   - _“This is why we classify sensitive information...”_
   - _“Let me show you how proper structure saves hours of searching...”_
   - _“When to use Teams, Viva Engage, and SharePoint effectively...”_

   In these modules, we clearly delineated when to use each tool:

   - **Teams:** For real-time collaboration, meetings, and project-based work.
   - **Viva Engage:** For company-wide communications, community building, and informal discussions.
   - **SharePoint:** For document management, intranet sites, and long-term content storage.

2. **Assessment:** After the course, users answered key questions to ensure they grasped the governance principles and the appropriate use cases for each platform. Only then could they proceed to be able to new Teams or groups.

3. **Templates for Success:** We provided a variety of templates tailored to different departmental needs. These templates offered predefined structures for various use cases, making it easier for users to set up their Teams and SharePoint sites correctly from the start.

4. **Classification Guidelines:** We introduced a clear classification system for Teams, Viva Engage, and SharePoint uses. This helped users understand the appropriate use cases for each type of resource, ensuring consistency and compliance across the organization.

## Cost and Maintenance Savings

By focusing on education, we eliminated the need for expensive third-party governance solutions. This approach not only saved on initial costs but also reduced ongoing maintenance expenses. Users became self-sufficient, requiring fewer support tickets and less intervention from IT.

Moreover, maintenance of our governance system was straightforward. It involved **only keeping the educational content and quizzes updated** to reflect any changes in policies or new best practices. This minimal maintenance ensured that the governance framework remained relevant and effective without the continuous overhead associated with managing complex third-party tools.

## The Digital Janitor

While education was our foundation, we didn’t abandon automation altogether. We implemented what I call the "digital janitor"—background processes that help maintain order:

- **Inactivity Reminders:** After six months of inactivity, team owners receive a friendly reminder to archive their team.
- **Follow-Up Nudges:** If there’s no response, another nudge is sent 30 days later.
- **Automatic Archiving:** Still no action? The team is automatically archived.

This approach isn’t about control; it’s about maintaining a clean and efficient M365 environment without overwhelming users.

## Building a Community

The most powerful tool turned out to be the simplest: a space in Viva Engage where users could share their experiences and solutions. I’ve seen this work across numerous clients—people learn better from their peers than from consultants.

As users began sharing their success stories and tips, governance became part of the culture rather than an imposed set of rules. This community-driven approach fostered a sense of ownership and collaboration around governance practices.

## The Results That Matter

Six months into this educational approach at one client, the results were impressive:

- **Support tickets about Teams, SharePoint, and Viva Engage dropped by 80%**
- **User satisfaction soared**
- **No need for an expensive governance tool**
- **Storage costs were reduced through better organization**

But the most meaningful outcome? Hearing a finance director tell a new employee, "Let me show you how we organize our M365 resources. It just makes sense."

## The Lesson Learned

Implementing this approach across various organizations has taught me an invaluable lesson: good governance isn’t about control—it’s about empowerment through understanding.

Yes, we still use automation and have policies and procedures in place. But they support the human element rather than trying to replace it. You can’t throw technology at an educational issue; users need to know what they are doing to make governance effective.
