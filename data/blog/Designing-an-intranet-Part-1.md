# Part 1 Where to begin

## Introduction

As a SharePoint consultant for almost a decade, I have built and designed more than 80 intranets and gained valuable insights from each project. In this post, I want to share some best practices for designing your intranet and what it involves, because I have noticed many implementations that are not optimal, scalable or sustainable, and that result in extra costs for maintenance and support.

So see these posts as a handbook if you ever get stuck and wondering what you should do

## What's needed to succeed

There are a few things that are needed to succeed when building your Intranet, The way you want to drive this kind of project is to have a a flexible and iterative approach. As such a project no matter the size of the company does not to be developed for a year before being released but your can release it in stages and having continous improvements. As you want to get in the users feedback and implementing those as we want this to grow and improve organicly.

This doesn't mean that it doesn't requires careful planning, coordination and execution because it does.

As the Intranet is a the hub that connects employees within an organization and facilitates communication, collaboration and information sharing. You want your users to come here, get the information that they need with as few clicks as possible and not be a dreaded process to do so! We want to get rid of the old stigma that the Intranet is something you don't to visit. This is where Viva connection comes in play.

To succeed when building an Intranet, these are a few things that are needed:

- A clear vision and strategy: The Intranet should align with the organization's goals, values and culture. It should also have a well-defined purpose, scope and target audience. The Intranet should be designed with the employee experience in mind, the information presented to the user should relevant for them as this is needs and expectations of the users.

- A dedicated team and stakeholders: The Intranet project should have a strong and committed team that includes representatives from different departments, roles and levels of the organization. My prefered method of building a team for designing and building a teams

While a team of stakeholders are should include these heads of departments:

- Head of HR
- Head of Communication
- Head of IT
- Head of CISO

The team should have the necessary skills, resources and authority to manage the project effectively. The team should also have a clear leader who can provide direction, guidance and support throughout the project lifecycle.

- A user-centric approach: The Intranet should be built with the users in mind. The team should conduct user research, surveys, interviews and testing to understand the user needs, preferences and behaviors. The team should also involve the users in the design, development and evaluation of the Intranet, and solicit their feedback and suggestions regularly. The Intranet should be user-friendly, intuitive and accessible to all users.
- A robust technology platform: The Intranet should be built on a reliable, secure and scalable technology platform that can support the functionality, performance and growth of the Intranet. The platform should also be compatible with the existing systems and applications of the organization, and allow for easy integration and customization. The platform should also enable the team to update and maintain the Intranet easily and efficiently.
- A continuous improvement process: The Intranet should not be seen as a one-time project, but as an ongoing process that requires constant monitoring, evaluation and improvement. The team should measure the usage, impact and satisfaction of the Intranet, and identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the Intranet. The team should also implement changes and enhancements based on the data, feedback and best practices of the Intranet.

Stakeholders! An modern intranet isn't owned by IT anymore. It's owned by the whole organisation and each part owning their own space.

## Stakeholders

One of the key aspects of planning and implementing an intranet in SharePoint is to define the roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders involved. An intranet in SharePoint is not a single entity, but a collection of sites, hubs, and pages that are owned and managed by various departments and teams. Each department or team has its own hub site, which serves as the main entry point and navigation hub for their content and services. The hub site owner is responsible for creating, maintaining, and governing the hub site and its associated sites.

In addition to the hub site owners, there is also a need for a service owner for SharePoint and Viva Connections. The service owner is responsible for overseeing the overall strategy, design, and governance of the intranet platform. The service owner works with the hub site owners to ensure that the intranet meets the needs and expectations of the organization and its users. The service owner also coordinates the communication, training, and support for the intranet platform.

For example, the communication department may own the landing page and the country pages of the intranet. The landing page is the first page that users see when they access the intranet, and it provides an overview of the organization's vision, values, news, and events. The country pages are sub-sites that provide localized information and resources for each country or region where the organization operates. The communication department is responsible for creating and updating these pages, as well as ensuring that they are consistent with the organization's brand and identity.

The HR department may own an HR hub site, which contains information and services related to human resources, such as employee handbook, policies, benefits, payroll, performance management, learning and development, etc. The HR department is responsible for creating and updating these pages, as well as ensuring that they comply with the legal and regulatory requirements of each country or region.

## Users in mind

One of the key aspects of intranet design is understanding what users really value as well as requiring a deep understanding of what users really need, and how to deliver information that is relevant, accessible and convenient for them. This is something I've seen been forgotten when designing intranets.
This is something that makes Viva Connections is such a great tool! It allows users to access the intranet with minimal clicks and provides a comprehensive overview with Viva Home especially on the go.

Another thing that users appreciate is having clear guidance on the purpose and use of different tools. For instance, in my case, SharePoint is for working and sharing information such as news, documents, information in general, while Viva Engage is for community and culture especially erasing the bounders of sharing data. So a department should have a Viva Engage community where they can chat and share information, as well as use the associated SharePoint site for news and so on. And Teams is for projects and collaborations and personal chats.

## Underlaying strcuture

The structure of an Intranet is a crucial factor that determines its effectiveness and usability. In my daily work, I see alot of confusion and inconsistency in how to plan and implement an Intranet, how to use hubsites to create a coherent and logical hierarchy, and how to optimize them to enhance the information flow and user satisfaction. This leads to alot of problems, as the Intranet should be able to adapt and evolve with the organisation's needs, growth and goals, without requiring major overhauls in the future. The structure is like a foundation of an an house, and if it is not done well, it will collapse.

Hubsites enable us to organize SharePoint sites based on the information context, rather than the site structure. For example, we can create a hub for HR and connect all the sites that are relevant to HR, such as policies, benefits, training, etc. By doing so, we can empower the HR team to manage their own hub navigation giving them more options, without relying on IT. We can also leverage the hub features to surface context-specific content, such as news from all the HR sites, or to conduct searches within the HR scope. However, I have observed that many users are not aware of or do not utilize this connection, and fail to take advantage.
