# My Approach to Governance in M365 - Part 2

In Part 1, we focused on the foundational principles of governance, emphasizing the importance of education and user empowerment. In this installment, we’ll explore the next step: leveraging automation to streamline governance and maintain a clean, secure, and efficient Microsoft 365 (M365) environment.

## Why Automation Matters

Governance often falls apart when it relies too heavily on manual processes. Automation bridges the gap by:

- **Reducing Human Error:** Automating repetitive tasks ensures consistency and accuracy.
- **Saving Time:** Eliminating manual steps frees up IT and business users for higher-value work.
- **Maintaining Order:** Automated processes help prevent sprawl and enforce compliance without micromanaging users.
- **Improving User Experience:** Simplified workflows make governance intuitive rather than restrictive.

The goal isn’t to replace human judgment but to make the right decisions easier and more consistent.

## The Building Blocks of M365 Automation

Effective automation starts with identifying the areas that cause the most pain or inefficiency. Here are the key components I focus on:

### 1. The "New Team" Guardian

When a user creates a new M365 Group, automation ensures that:

- **Duplicate Check:** Prevents creation of similar or redundant groups.
- **Naming Standards:** (If used) Applies predefined naming conventions automatically.
- **Default Policies:** Enforces retention and compliance policies based on the group type.
- **Template Setup:** Adds required channels, tabs, or document libraries.

This reduces confusion, avoids sprawl, and ensures new groups align with organizational standards.

### 2. The "Digital Janitor"

Keeping M365 clean is an ongoing challenge. Automation can handle:

- **Inactive Group Notifications:** Alerts owners about unused groups or sites.
- **Automatic Archiving:** Archives groups that remain inactive after multiple reminders.
- **Guest Access Reviews:** Ensures external users still need access and removes those who don’t.

These processes maintain an organized environment while minimizing IT involvement.

### 3. The "Content Cop"

Automation can proactively manage data sensitivity and compliance by:

- **Scanning for Sensitive Content:** Identifies and classifies documents containing sensitive information.
- **Applying Labels:** Automatically applies sensitivity or retention labels based on predefined rules.
- **Monitoring Sharing Activity:** Flags unusual sharing behavior or unauthorized access attempts.

By catching issues early, this approach reduces the risk of data breaches and compliance violations.

### 4. Access Management

Proper access control is critical for governance. Automation can:

- **Enforce Role-Based Access:** Ensures users have the appropriate permissions based on their role.
- **Periodic Reviews:** Prompts group owners to review and update permissions regularly.
- **Remove Stale Accounts:** Identifies and disables unused accounts or those with excessive privileges.

This improves security and ensures only the right people have access to the right resources.

## Real-World Success Stories

Here are a few examples of how automation transformed governance for my clients:

### Case 1: The Self-Cleaning Teams

A client struggled with hundreds of unused Teams cluttering their environment. By implementing an automated cleanup process:

- **60% of Inactive Teams Were Archived:** Reducing clutter and freeing up storage.
- **Owner Engagement Increased:** Automated reminders prompted owners to take action on their Teams.
- **Improved User Experience:** A cleaner workspace made it easier to find active Teams.

### Case 2: Proactive Data Protection

A financial services client faced compliance challenges due to sensitive data being shared improperly. Automation helped:

- **Classify and Protect Data:** Automatically applied sensitivity labels to critical files.
- **Monitor External Sharing:** Flagged and restricted inappropriate sharing.
- **Streamline Audits:** Improved audit readiness with detailed logs and reports.

The result? Fewer incidents and improved compliance scores.

## Making Automation Work for You

To get started with automation in M365 governance, follow these steps:

### 1. Identify Pain Points

Begin by pinpointing the most problematic areas in your governance process. Common examples include:

- Inactive groups or sites
- Uncontrolled external sharing
- Manual compliance tasks

### 2. Start Small

Focus on one high-impact area to build momentum. For example:

- Implement guest access reviews.
- Set up automated notifications for inactive groups.
- Apply sensitivity labels to shared files.

### 3. Measure Impact

Track metrics like time saved, user satisfaction, and compliance improvements to demonstrate the value of automation.

### 4. Iterate and Expand

Once you’ve seen success in one area, expand automation to other governance processes. Continuously refine your approach based on feedback and results.

## What’s Next?

In Part 3, we’ll dive into how to measure the effectiveness of your governance efforts. From tracking adoption metrics to showcasing ROI, I’ll share strategies for proving the value of your governance program.

_Pro Tip: Keep a "governance automation wishlist" to document ideas as you identify pain points. Review it regularly and prioritize based on impact and feasibility._
