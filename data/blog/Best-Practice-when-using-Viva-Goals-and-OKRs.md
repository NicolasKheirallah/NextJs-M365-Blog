# Best Practices for Tracking Your Progress in Viva Goals

Viva Goals is a goal-setting and management solution that aligns teams to your organization's strategic priorities, driving results and a thriving business with OKRs. OKRs stand for Objectives and Key Results, a framework that helps you define what you want to achieve (objectives) and how you will measure your progress (key results).

In this blog post, we will share some best practices for tracking your progress in Viva Goals, so you can stay focused, motivated, and aligned with your team and organization.

## 1. Check-in regularly

One of the key benefits of using Viva Goals is that it allows you to check-in with your OKRs anytime, anywhere. Checking-in means updating the status of your key results, adding comments or feedback, and adjusting your plans as needed.

Checking-in regularly helps you:

- Stay on track with your goals and priorities
- Communicate your progress and challenges to your team and manager
- Celebrate your wins and learn from your failures
- Identify any risks or blockers that need attention
- Adapt to changing circumstances or expectations

You can check-in with your OKRs in Viva Goals by clicking on the Check-in button on the top right corner of each key result card. You can also use the Review dashboard to see an overview of all your OKRs across different time periods.

## 2. Use projects to break down key results

Sometimes, achieving a key result may require multiple steps or tasks that need to be completed. In Viva Goals, you can use projects to break down key results into smaller milestones or deliverables.

Projects help you:

- Organize your work into manageable chunks
- Track your progress more granularly
- Assign owners and due dates for each project
- Integrate with other tools like Microsoft Planner or Azure DevOps

You can create projects in Viva Goals by clicking on the Add project button on each key result card. You can also view all your projects across different OKRs in the Projects tab.

## 3. Use integrations to sync data from other sources

Another way to track your progress in Viva Goals is to use integrations to sync data from other sources. Integrations allow you to connect Viva Goals with other tools or systems that you use to measure or manage your work.

Integrations help you:

- Automate data updates for key results
- Avoid manual errors or inconsistencies
- Save time and effort
- Access real-time information

You can use integrations in Viva Goals by clicking on the Add integration button on each key result card. You can choose from a variety of integrations such as Microsoft Power BI, Excel Online, Google Sheets, Salesforce, Jira Cloud, etc.

## 4. Score and close OKRs at the end of each time period

Finally, at the end of each time period (usually quarterly), you should score and close OKRs in Viva Goals. Scoring means rating how well you achieved each key result on a scale of 0% (not at all) to 100% (fully). Closing means marking each objective as completed or canceled.

Scoring and closing OKRs helps you:

- Evaluate your performance objectively
- Reflect on what worked well and what didn't
- Recognize achievements and areas for improvement
- Share feedback with others involved in OKRs
- Prepare for setting new OKRs for next time period

You can score and close OKRs in Viva Goals by clicking on the Score button on each objective card. You can also use the Review dashboard to see how well you scored across different time periods.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, OKRs and viva goals are two complementary frameworks that can help organizations and individuals achieve their desired outcomes. OKRs are useful for setting clear, measurable and ambitious objectives that align with the organization's vision and mission. Viva goals are useful for defining the values, behaviors and actions that support the achievement of the OKRs. By using both frameworks together, organizations and individuals can foster a culture of excellence, accountability and continuous improvement.
