# My Approach to Governance in M365 - Part 5

In the previous parts of this series, we explored building a strong governance foundation, leveraging automation, and fostering a culture of accountability. Now, it’s time to discuss how to measure the success of your governance efforts and evolve your strategies to ensure long-term impact and adaptability.

## Why Measuring Success Matters

Metrics are more than just numbers—they tell a story. They help you:

- **Validate Your Approach:** Prove that your governance initiatives are delivering results.
- **Identify Areas for Improvement:** Highlight gaps or inefficiencies in your processes.
- **Demonstrate ROI:** Show stakeholders the tangible benefits of governance.
- **Support Continuous Improvement:** Provide insights to refine and evolve your framework.

## Key Metrics for Governance Success

The metrics you choose should align with your organizational goals. Here are some key areas to focus on:

### 1. Adoption and Engagement

Track how well users are adopting governance practices and leveraging M365 tools:

- **Active Usage Rates:** How many users are actively using Teams, SharePoint, and Viva Engage?
- **Governance Feature Adoption:** Are users applying sensitivity labels, templates, and retention policies?
- **Training Participation:** What percentage of users have completed governance education courses?

### 2. Compliance and Security

Measure how effectively your governance framework supports compliance and security:

- **Policy Adherence Rates:** How many groups and sites comply with established policies?
- **Incident Reduction:** Track decreases in unauthorized sharing, data breaches, and compliance violations.
- **Access Review Completion:** Are group owners regularly reviewing and updating permissions?

### 3. Efficiency Gains

Quantify the operational improvements driven by governance:

- **Time Saved:** Compare time spent on tasks before and after governance implementation.
- **IT Support Load:** Measure reductions in governance-related support tickets.
- **Automation Success Rates:** How effectively are automated processes reducing manual effort?

### 4. User Satisfaction

Gauge how governance impacts the user experience:

- **Survey Results:** Collect feedback on ease of use, clarity of policies, and overall satisfaction.
- **Collaboration Metrics:** Are users finding it easier to collaborate across departments?
- **Governance Perception:** Do users see governance as a benefit rather than a barrier?

## Building a Governance Metrics Dashboard

A dashboard consolidates metrics into a visual, actionable format. Here’s how to create one:

### 1. Define Your Audience

Tailor your dashboard to meet the needs of different stakeholders:

- **Executives:** Highlight ROI, risk reduction, and alignment with business goals.
- **IT Teams:** Provide detailed insights into automation, compliance, and security.
- **Users:** Focus on collaboration improvements and training participation.

### 2. Leverage Tools

Use tools like Power BI to integrate data from M365 services and create dynamic visualizations. Automate data collection where possible to ensure real-time updates.

### 3. Focus on Storytelling

Numbers are more impactful when paired with context. Use your dashboard to:

- Show trends over time.
- Highlight specific successes, such as reduced incidents or increased efficiency.
- Provide actionable insights to guide future governance efforts.

## Evolving Your Governance Framework

Governance isn’t static. To stay effective, your framework must evolve with organizational changes and technological advancements. Here’s how:

### 1. Regular Reviews

Schedule periodic reviews to assess:

- **Policy Relevance:** Are your policies still aligned with organizational needs?
- **User Behavior:** Are there new challenges or patterns emerging?
- **Technology Updates:** Do new M365 features require adjustments to your framework?

### 2. Feedback Loops

Create channels for:

- **User Feedback:** Gather insights from employees on what’s working and what isn’t.
- **Stakeholder Input:** Engage leadership to align governance with business priorities.
- **IT Observations:** Monitor technical challenges and opportunities for improvement.

### 3. Expand Automation

As your framework matures, identify additional processes that can be automated to reduce manual effort and ensure consistency.

### 4. Scale Best Practices

Share successes across departments to encourage broader adoption of effective governance practices.

## Real-World Example: Proving Governance ROI

A global manufacturing company implemented a governance framework that included user education, automation, and metrics tracking. Here’s what they achieved:

1. **Adoption Metrics:** Training participation increased to 85%, and active usage of governance features reached 70%.
2. **Efficiency Gains:** Automated processes saved 1,500 IT hours annually.
3. **Compliance Success:** Policy adherence rates improved by 60%, and incident rates dropped by 75%.
4. **User Satisfaction:** Surveys showed a 90% satisfaction rate with governance processes.

The company used these results to justify further investments in governance tools and training, ensuring continued success.

## What’s Next?

In Part 6, we’ll look to the future of M365 governance, exploring how AI, adaptability, and continuous innovation can keep your framework relevant and effective in an ever-changing landscape.

_Pro Tip: Document your governance wins in a "success portfolio." Use it to inspire teams, secure stakeholder buy-in, and guide future initiatives._
