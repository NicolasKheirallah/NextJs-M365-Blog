# My Approach to Governance in M365 - Part 3

In the first two parts of this series, we covered the importance of education and automation in Microsoft 365 (M365) governance. Now, we’ll focus on a critical question: how do you measure the success of your governance efforts? Knowing what’s working (and what isn’t) is key to proving value and ensuring continuous improvement.

## Why Metrics Matter

Governance is an ongoing journey, not a one-time project. Metrics help you:

- **Validate Success:** Prove the effectiveness of your governance strategies.
- **Identify Weaknesses:** Pinpoint areas needing refinement or additional focus.
- **Demonstrate ROI:** Show stakeholders the tangible value of your efforts.
- **Guide Future Actions:** Inform decisions on scaling and iterating governance practices.

The challenge lies in choosing the right metrics that provide actionable insights rather than just numbers.

## Key Metrics for Governance Success

### 1. Adoption Metrics

User adoption is a strong indicator of governance effectiveness. Track:

- **Active Users:** How many employees actively use M365 tools such as Teams, SharePoint, or Viva Engage?
- **Feature Adoption:** Are users leveraging governance-related features like sensitivity labels, templates, and automation tools?
- **Training Completion Rates:** What percentage of users have completed governance education courses?

### 2. Compliance Metrics

Governance is often driven by compliance requirements. Measure:

- **Policy Compliance Rates:** How many groups, teams, or sites comply with retention, sharing, and classification policies?
- **Data Protection Success:** Track incidents of unauthorized access or data leaks—fewer is better.
- **Access Reviews:** What percentage of groups have up-to-date permissions?

### 3. Efficiency Metrics

Efficient governance saves time and resources. Monitor:

- **Time Saved:** Compare pre- and post-governance times for common tasks, like finding documents or sharing files.
- **IT Workload Reduction:** Track decreases in support tickets related to governance.
- **Automation Effectiveness:** Measure the success rates of automated processes, such as inactive group cleanups.

### 4. Collaboration Metrics

Governance should enhance collaboration, not hinder it. Evaluate:

- **Team Utilization:** What percentage of Teams or SharePoint sites are actively used?
- **Cross-Department Collaboration:** Are different departments using shared tools and resources effectively?
- **User Satisfaction:** Conduct surveys to gauge how governance impacts collaboration.

## Building Your Governance Dashboard

A governance dashboard consolidates your metrics into a clear, actionable format. Here’s how to create one:

### 1. Identify Your Audience

Tailor your dashboard to stakeholders’ needs:

- **Executives:** Focus on ROI, risk reduction, and strategic alignment.
- **IT Teams:** Highlight automation effectiveness, compliance, and workload impacts.
- **Users:** Showcase improvements in collaboration and ease of use.

### 2. Choose Visualization Tools

Microsoft tools like Power BI integrate seamlessly with M365, allowing you to:

- Create real-time dashboards.
- Automate data collection from Teams, SharePoint, and Azure.
- Generate visualizations that highlight key trends.

### 3. Focus on Storytelling

Numbers alone don’t inspire action. Use your dashboard to tell a story:

- Show progress over time.
- Highlight successes and areas of improvement.
- Use real-world examples to make metrics relatable.

## Success Stories: Metrics in Action

### Case 1: Adoption Metrics Drive ROI

A client’s M365 adoption rates increased by 40% after implementing governance education and automation. This translated to:

- **Improved Productivity:** Reduced duplicate efforts saved 2 hours per user per week.
- **Reduced Costs:** Eliminated the need for third-party tools, saving $250,000 annually.

### Case 2: Compliance Metrics Prevent Fines

For a financial services firm, tracking compliance metrics ensured:

- **100% Policy Adherence:** All sensitive documents were classified and protected.
- **Avoided Penalties:** Proactive compliance measures prevented a $500,000 fine.

## Iterating Based on Metrics

Governance isn’t static. Use your metrics to:

- **Refine Policies:** Address areas of non-compliance with targeted training or automation.
- **Expand Automation:** Identify additional manual processes that can be automated.
- **Enhance User Training:** Focus on the tools or concepts users struggle with most.

## What’s Next?

In Part 4, we’ll explore how to build a culture of governance within your organization. From engaging stakeholders to turning users into governance advocates, we’ll cover the human side of making governance stick.

_Pro Tip: Keep a running list of success stories tied to your metrics. These are invaluable when presenting to stakeholders or justifying future governance investments._
