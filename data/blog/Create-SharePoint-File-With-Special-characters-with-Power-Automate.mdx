So a common problem with creating new files in Power Automate is that you can't use special characters, which can be a bit annoying! But there is a workaround for this and this is to use the HTTP Request connector for SharePoint!

This is how:

1. Create Your flow

2. Search for the Connector Send an HTTP request to SharePoint

3. Add these Values:

```
| Input        | Value                                                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Site Adress  | Your Site                                                                            |
| Method:      | Post                                                                                 |
| URI:         | \_api/web/lists/getByTitle('YourLibrary')/getitembyid(ItemID)/validateUpdateListItem |
| Header:      |
| accept       | application/JSON; odata=verbose                                                      |
| content-type | application/JSON; odata=verbose                                                      |
| Body         |
```

```JSON
{
  "formValues": [
    {
      "__metadata": { "type": "SP.ListItemFormUpdateValue" },
      "FieldName": "FileLeafRef",
      "FieldValue": "FileNameYouWantToUse"
    }
  ],
  "bNewDocumentUpdate": true,
  "checkInComment": "Updated Filename" //This is optional
}
```

It should look something like this
