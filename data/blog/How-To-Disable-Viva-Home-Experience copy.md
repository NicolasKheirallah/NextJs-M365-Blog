## Intro

So I've gotten this question a couple of times so I decided to make a guide on how to set it up!
You might be wondering why would anyone just want Viva Home and not have their landing page in SharePoint?
Well there's several reasons you might want this, Your organisation might not have their intranet in SharePoint but in other systems but you still want to harness the power of Connections and Viva Home.

- You have an existing intranet system that is not based on SharePoint, but you still want to benefit from the features of Connections and Viva Home.
- You have frontline workers who need to access information quickly and easily, without having to navigate through SharePoint.
- You are aware of the upcoming redesign of Viva Home, which will include many of the functionalities that a Homesite provides, such as a news feed, links, user-defined links and more.

## Requirements
